# zebra
**Description:** 
a maven plugin which count lines

**Background:**
Sometimes,we want to get some information from our code,
such as the number of lines of code,defect rate,defect density.But at this momentï¼Œ
we don't have enough tools to do this.So,I want to make a maven plugin to achieve 
this goal.

**Instructions:**

_step1:_   Clone this project and install to your maven repository(mvn clean install)

_step2:_   Now you can use this plugin easily.You should add this plugin in your pom.xml
like this 
<plugin>
<groupId>com.servyou.zs</groupId>
<artifactId>zebra</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<executions>
<execution>
<phase>compile</phase>
<goals>
<goal>count</goal>
</goals>
</execution>
</executions>
<configuration>
<detail>true</detail>
<source>${basedir}</source>
</configuration>
</plugin>

_step3:_   run maven command(like mvn compile),you will get the information

**Version**

In this first version,I have achieved only one function,you can use it to count 
code lines.
